# Color Guide 

Create a color guide in sass!

**Instructions**:
* Look at the mockup image for a guide.
* Nest selectors where possible.
* Use variables so that you can update and change the main colors easily.
* Use mixins where possible.
* Give detail about the colors used eg. Hex color code and RGB color code on the page.
* The page must be responsive.
* You should have a guide of at least four colors.
* Use darken and lighten on your color guide.

## Bonus:

### Refactoring Assignment

Put all your sass variables in a _variables.scss file, your mixins in a _mixins.scss, and the rest in a _layout.scss, so that your main.scss contains only @import statements.  Your scss directory should have the structure shown on the attached screenshot.
