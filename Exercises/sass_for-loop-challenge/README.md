# For-Loop Challenge:
(sass_for-loop-challenge)

    1. Create a page that looks like the attached mock-up but without background colors.

    2. Give the element with text “Color Sample 15” the background color red. (This can be done in many ways.)

    3. Now use a for-loop to give this element the background color red.

    4. Next use a for-loop to give this element the background color red and the other elements the background color pink.

    [Bonus] Use a for-loop to give an element the background color ->

    * red if its number is evenly divisible by 3 and by 5
    * blue if its number is evenly divisible by 3 but not by 5
    * green if its number is evenly divisible by 5 but not by 3
    * pink if its number is evenly divisible by neither 3 nor 5.

    Use npm and Sass. The directory structure is up to you.
