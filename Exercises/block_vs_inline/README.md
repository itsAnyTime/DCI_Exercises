### Block vs. Inline: (same folder name)

    Create an index.html file with 3 paragraphs, each containing the words “This is a paragraph”.
    Draw a border around each element.
    In one of the paragraphs, enclose one word in <em> tags and another one in <strong> tags.
    Inspect a paragraph in DevTools. Change its width and height.
    Inspect the <em> element in DevTools.  Try to change its width and height.  What do you notice?
    Now set the display property of the <em> element to “block” and try again to change its width and height.  What do you notice?
    Change the display property of the paragraphs to “inline”.
    Inspect a paragraph with DevTools and try to change margin and padding.  What changed?
    Undo the changes to the display properties.
    Wrap all elements in a <main> element and give <main> a width of 80%.
    What can you infer about the default width of block-level elements like paragraphs?
    Change the display property of the <em> and <strong> elements to “block”.  Change their margin and padding.  Now change the display property to “inline-block”.  How does this differ from “display: block” and “display: inline”?
    Give the <em> and <strong> elements a display property of “inline” and the paragraphs a display property of “block”.
    Give a paragraph a width of 300px and a padding of 20px.  Inspect the result with DevTools.  Which of the boxes associated with this paragraph  (content-box, padding-box, border-box, margin-box) has a width of 300px?
    (Bonus) Ensure that, for any (current or future) element on this page, width applies to the border-box.
