# Each-Loop Challenge:

    1. Create a page with 7 block-level elements, one for each day of the week. 

    2. Use a Sass map to specify a unique color for each day of the week.

    3. Use an @each-loop to assign each element its appropriate color (i.e., the element “Monday” gets the Monday-color, the Tuesday-element gets the Tuesday-color, and so on).
