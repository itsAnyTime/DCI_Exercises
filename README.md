As you check what your HTML looks like when the browser renders it, familiarize yourself with the browser's developer tools. They allow you to inspect your HTML and CSS and try out changes! If you're using Chrome, you can learn more about its dev tools [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/?utm_source=dcc&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=2016q3).

### Block vs. Inline: (same foldergit  name)

    Create an index.html file with 3 paragraphs, each containing the words “This is a paragraph”.
    Draw a border around each element.
    In one of the paragraphs, enclose one word in <em> tags and another one in <strong> tags.
    Inspect a paragraph in DevTools. Change its width and height.
    Inspect the <em> element in DevTools.  Try to change its width and height.  What do you notice?
    Now set the display property of the <em> element to “block” and try again to change its width and height.  What do you notice?
    Change the display property of the paragraphs to “inline”.
    Inspect a paragraph with DevTools and try to change margin and padding.  What changed?
    Undo the changes to the display properties.
    Wrap all elements in a <main> element and give <main> a width of 80%.
    What can you infer about the default width of block-level elements like paragraphs?
    Change the display property of the <em> and <strong> elements to “block”.  Change their margin and padding.  Now change the display property to “inline-block”.  How does this differ from “display: block” and “display: inline”?
    Give the <em> and <strong> elements a display property of “inline” and the paragraphs a display property of “block”.
    Give a paragraph a width of 300px and a padding of 20px.  Inspect the result with DevTools.  Which of the boxes associated with this paragraph  (content-box, padding-box, border-box, margin-box) has a width of 300px?
    (Bonus) Ensure that, for any (current or future) element on this page, width applies to the border-box.
